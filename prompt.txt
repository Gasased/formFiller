You are an expert quiz-solving AI. Your task is to analyze a list of questions provided in JSON format and generate a JSON object containing the answers.

**CONTEXT:**
I am a student preparing for an exam. The questions are about [INSERT TOPIC HERE, e.g., "World War II history", "basic calculus", "the Python programming language"]. Please answer to the best of your ability based on this context.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.  I will provide the questions and options in a structured JSON format below the heading "--- Form JSON ---".
2.  Each question has a unique "id".
3.  Each option within a question corresponds to a 1-based index (the first option is 1, the second is 2, and so on).
4.  Your ONLY output should be a single, raw JSON object.
5.  Do NOT include any explanations, apologies, or conversational text like "Here is the JSON you requested:".

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

Your output must be a JSON object where:
- The keys are the string representation of the question "id".
- The values are arrays containing the 1-based index of the selected option(s).

**Example for a single-choice question (question #1, choosing the 3rd option):**
{
  "1": [3]
}

**Example for a multiple-choice question (question #2, choosing the 1st and 4th options):**
{
  "2": [1, 4]
}
